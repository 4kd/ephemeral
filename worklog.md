# TODO
[] Complete entry creation via geolocation and datetime

Basic page, editing/adding
  [X] Factor out view & update for word input into module (page?)
  [X] Add boilerplate
  [?] Add list page

[] Show Errors for entry creation

[] Figure out where to put encodeEntry, especially b/c of "config" construct (duplicated atm)

NOTE: A bit redundant to have "pages" atm. It is more like separating the updates, views etc. rather than routes (hence sharing a view in Main)

# Base
Abstract Requests API
Offline detection and queueing
Localhost usage

# Later
[] Leaflet integration

# Dev
Consider elm and elm-live dev dependencies
NPM scripts for building, starting elm-live

# Real Data
Might need to change ordering of id, encoding of floats
